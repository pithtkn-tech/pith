"""
Example: Using Pith with Ollama (local LLM).

1. Start Ollama: ollama serve
2. Set env: PITH_DEFAULT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
3. Start Pith: pith serve
4. Run: python examples/ollama_example.py

Pith optimizes prompts even for local models — effectively
extending your context window by 10-20%.
